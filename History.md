# ICF-PJSI
## Indicator Frameworks for Sustainability | Localising and Adapting SDG frameworks Using National Public Datasets | Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

## Commits over the course of the Project
This project was done at TISS for the 3rd semester and was developed accordingly afterwards. All coding outside excel started since 23-12-2024. The plan is to publish this (Scrollytelling + Interactive Indicator Sandbox) for Closeread's submissions

### 23-12-2024
- Created 2 trial versions of the RShiny application without maps.
  - Faced issues with coding across the dataset.
  - Explored the Closeread documentation briefly and gleaned some insights.

#### Tasks for the Next Commit:
- Explore the application further.

### 24-12-2024
- Created 2 trial versions with maps but failed to achieve desired results.
- Explored how GenAI can assist with coding.
- Investigated the limitations of RShiny.

#### Tasks for the Next Commit:
- Create a version without complex UI/UX elements but use `ggplot` for prototyping.
- Develop a structured pseudocode as a foundation.

### 25-12-2024
- Created 3 grid graphs for prototyping:
  1. A map application using SHPs.
  2. Barcharts displaying indicators and states for each target.
  - Simplified the process using these approaches.
- Implemented filters for target variable values.
- Converted the grids into an actionable UI.
- Applied a color scheme to create a gradient base under UI Prototype version 2.1.
- Began documenting commits (this format starts here).

#### Tasks for the Next Commit:
- Reduce loading times from 5–10 seconds to under 1 second.
- Use GitHub for managing the commit process.
- Improve the current layouts (the existing ones are suboptimal).
- Add functionality:
  - If a user clicks a state or indicator, navigate to a different page within the project that shows a matrix of states and indicators as rows and columns, highlighting the relevant row, column, or cell.
- Design a layout superior to NITI Aayog’s.
- Further explore Closeread for integration.
- Develop a scrollytelling narrative using Closeread.
